Over the years, Marketing Magazine has included me as a Top 100 Marketer in their 100th Anniversary Edition and the National Post has named me a Top Innovator. I've worked at the intersection of marketing, communications and content my entire career.

As a senior B2B and B2C executive who has successfully bridged the gap between founding a ground-breaking startup and scaling to lead inside the large enterprise, I thrive on collaborating across teams to empower, support and guide amazing people to deliver extraordinary results.

At SAP, our team successfully executed a massive three-year Board-mandated digital transformation project that completely redefined our digital channels. We delivered new best-in-class digital experiences for customers, partners, developers and our online community (in less than 30 months), as well as helping the Global Sales organization transform the way they do business through social selling. We also supported SAP’s award-winning “Run Simple” global brand campaign, and for the first time, provided the company with accountability on revenue contribution from digital marketing activities.

While at Social Media Group, we pioneered the use of paid social media marketing (we were among the first customers for both Twitter and Outbrain) and developed the widely used ""Social Media RFP"" template as a marketing tool.

While I don't really like the term ""thought leader"", I do frequently write about and also speak on social/digital transformation and leadership to global conference audiences and the media, and have been interviewed and profiled variously by Inc. Magazine, The Washington Post, The Globe and Mail, The Toronto Star, CBC Radio and the Financial Post, among others.

Prior to joining Manulife, I had been in a senior and strategic marketing role at Tim Hortons running the Marketing Centre of Excellence (Canada & USA), leading research & insights, creative communications, media/experiential, packaging, Customer experience, digital and loyalty.

The goal is to better a client’s business objectives and retail performance from a brand, shopper and retailer’s experience perspective.

Further enhancing this predictive approach, is the potential to utilise unique tools that bridge the divide between subjective and fact based decision making. The result is pioneering work done by Domenic in integrating live shopper experience trials in a unique lab environment that further strengthens a client’s confidence that their retail programs will meet or exceed their retail experience and business objective.

Passion, design, and client service is not simply reserved for the work that has dominated his career to this point. More importantly, it is having the privilege of leading, directing, managing and coaching diverse groups of energetic and highly motivated designers. The ultimate goal to build high performing, efficiently operating design teams that are confident enough to meet any challenge that a client may have.",,,domenic.cecol@centralgrp.com,,False,,,,True,2018-08-08 16:59:55.549,"Hi Domenic, I came across your profile and think you'd be a good fit for a breakfast I host once a month at Soho House.

I have led the Fund Development function within an international non-governmental organization (NGO) and led up to a team fourteen direct reports. I have worked alongside, recruited, trained and managed volunteers at different levels of involvement and engagement.

My strengths are:

- I bring a holistic organizational lens to the Fund Development profession
- I am an excellent communicator, leader, strategic thinker and mentor
- I am customer, outcome and detailed oriented
- My knowledge, understanding and experience with a wide range of fund development methods
- I possess strong analytical, planning, monitoring and evaluation abilities
- I believe in fostering a culture and work style of respect, collaboration, accountability and performance
- I am a self professed ""Geek at Heart"" at ease using technology with a comprehensive understanding and experience using CRM databases (specifically Raiser's Edge and Salesforce)",,,,,False,,,,True,2018-08-08 17:18:08.674,"Hi Nicole, I came across your profile and think you'd be a good fit for a breakfast I host once a month at Soho House.

Senior sales, marketing and executive positions at companies of various sizes have provided a keen understanding of the challenges and opportunities unique to these organizations.

I am a creative and practical thinker who combines innovative, compelling ideas with realistic processes ensuring strong execution and success. I am known as a dynamic presence who communicates concepts effectively to motivate people to action, while my strategic approach works because of this ability to see the big idea and its real potential as well as its day-to-day ramifications.

A superb relationship-builder who connects with people at all levels, I have a strong customer service orientation, know what motivates people, and have learned collaboration and effective teamwork are essential to success.

I began my career as a publicist and learned balancing the needs of numerous stakeholders while getting word out effectively was essential for success. Becoming publisher of a magazine gave me a solid understanding of business management with a focus on revenue generation, and setting and executing strategy. My subsequent positions honed these skills even more.

I’m currently in the sports business, but spent the past few years growing Canada’s largest beer festival. Recently, I led the team that built the social and digital practice at Maple Leafs Sports & Entertainment (the largest sports ownership group in Canada) where we delivered award-winning best practices in social media and digital content with the sole purpose of enhancing the relationship between fans & the brands of the Toronto Maple Leafs, Toronto Raptors, and Toronto FC. Some may remember me as the Director of Marketing for legendary radio station 102.1 the Edge in Toronto. During my tenure the station received the highest ratings ever in its 27-year history. I was also lucky enough to be the three-time recipient of the Gold Ribbon from the Canadian Association of Broadcasters for radio marketing.

Multi-tasking comes naturally to me and I’m fortunate to have found a career that allows me to exercise those skills. Working at a public relations agency lets me work on a variety of clients, doing a variety of things. And what really drives me is bringing my two areas of expertise together; public relations and social media.

The first allows me to use my well-honed skills in event planning, media relations and corporate communications for clients across a variety of sectors. On these accounts, I develop strategic communications programs for clients that align with their business goals. I strive to create programs that are creative and fully integrated. The media and marketing landscapes are constantly changing and the best PR campaigns are the ones that incorporate all of the tools at our disposal.

My second area of expertise is a big part of my role at Media Profile where I offer social media counsel and training to our roster of clients. Coming from a corporate communications background, I see social media as an essential tool to reaching specific audiences. Social is complementary to all other communications efforts. When PR and social media work in tandem – this is where the magic happens. And that’s what I do.

Some of the things you might find me doing on a given day are:
• Providing strategic media relations and social media counsel to clients that considers their overall objectives
• Hosting social media training sessions (in-person or via webinar)
• Drafting or advising on editorial content, video and images to best tell a client’s story online
• Devising new ways to reach target audiences and stakeholders

I have experience in the banking, government, health, food, automotive, online, retail, consumer, and non-profit worlds.

However, with the proliferation of social media, the need to be recognized and acknowledged is not enough. Your company, product/brand, service needs to engage with your market, converse with your target on an on-going basis... because chances are, your competitors are doing just that.

If you own a business, sell a product or a service then you need a fully integrated marketing, branding, advertising (traditional and social) and internet strategy mapped out to navigate through today’s increasingly cluttered marketplace.

No matter your industry (financial, insurance, food, technology, retail, cosmetic, medical, pharmaceutical, service) if you need assistance in Direct to Consumer or B2B for:
• Branding and launching your company, product or service (design, positioning statement, research)
• Developing a full scope advertising and internet strategy (media planning and all platform implementation)
Then we should connect.

Having held a number of senior marketing positions entailing strategic marketing planning, product/brand management, retail marketing, communications and advertising in the service, technology, pharmaceutical, medical, cosmetic and food industries followed with over 20 years of spearheading branding and initiatives at 3H Communications, I understand the importance of turning marketing investments into ROIs….

If you’re not sure how to stand apart within a very noisy marketing place… creatively integrating brand messaging in multi-platforms and reaching objectives, then let’s talk!

Which business are you in? The business of selling your products, or helping your customers buy your products?
I am Data-driven marketer with a strong passion for ABM and CRO.

I also believe that using various influencer types in a well thought social media strategy is important in accelerating pipeline velocity.
I have extensive experience in UX, usability, digital marketing/strategy, web analytics and e-commerce.
Whether its a long complex B2B buying cycle or e-commerce, I can increase the conversion rate for you and most importantly, I can help you learn more about your customers' motivations. I have excellent communication skills and solid experience with creating great user experiences and pages that convert.
I furthermore enjoy optimizing for SEO/SEM, following key influencers and taking part in content development with focus on using social media properly. I am very creative and enjoy finding innovative ways to re-imagine a website and increase qualified leads.
I am curious and relentless in the search of answers through data and have proven skills in analytical thinking and problem solving.

There’s no other way to put it. I’m a proud sales professional who takes the art of sales seriously and I. LOVE. IT.

“What is it that makes you love sales so much Eric?” - Glad you asked my casual LinkedIn surfer friend...

...I love sales because I’m a people pleaser and this profession allows me to help people find solutions that make their lives easier. Sales satisfies my passion for building meaningful relationships through it's unlimited opportunities to meet new people. I love sales because change is a constant – every day, every relationship & every deal is unique. Sales necessitates constant learning and self-improvement. You get the point.

My broad sales & marketing experience spans the broadcast, entertainment, automotive, wireless, and hospitality sectors and both B2B and B2C sales.

If you were to talk to my colleagues, they'd say things like “That Eric guy…”
• ..was integral in generating awesome sales performance and driving profitability.
• ..has sharp instincts & an analytical approach to deliver measurable results.
• ..is a true leader who believes in empowering people & helping them grow.
• ..is an engaging speaker & presenter who exudes contagious passion.

Yeah, I made these up but I’m pretty sure they'd say things like this.

Career accomplishments I'm genuinely proud of are:
• Development of sales programs that generated 40% of new subscriber acquisitions annually for the #1 media subscription organization in Canada - SiriusXM
• Rewarded as the top Smart car sales rep in Canada in 2005 & 2006, exceeding sales targets by 30%

On a personal front, I get thrills from the masochism of marathon canoe racing & canoe tripping. Want to talk music, pop-culture or sports, bring it on – let's debate greatest albums of all time, talk Breaking Bad, or chat worst trades ever. I love travel, fine scotch & good jokes.

I got a chance to do some great work for clients like Adobe, Cadbury, Koodo, TELUS and Kwik Kopy, just to name a few. Forging great client relationships and leading my team was one of the most challenging and rewarding things I’ve ever done. In 2010, I sold to a large agency named Colour. After the acquisition I stayed on as Vice President of Digital until the merging of the two teams was complete.

While running my own agency I watched in awe at the growth and success of JAM, a Direct Response agency run by my two-time former boss, Sean Garvey. JAM’s ability to deliver results to its clients attracted great people, new clients, and eventually, my own jealously. When the opportunity came to join JAM and help kick their digital offerings into high gear, it was an easy decision to make.

I am currently Director of Digital for JAM Direct, responsible for expanding its digital services and forging relationships with our clients. I’m adding my digital experience to the outstanding client service and best-work-at-all-costs formula that JAM is so well known for. We’re excited to help clients get the right message to the right audience through direct, email, web and social channels. Our process starts with our lightweight needs analysis method , ‘Re-think’, to tee up the challenge , and ends with full-service, in-house design and development.

My ultimate passion is helping people solve problems. If you have any digital challenges I’d love to hear them – so please reach out.

I care deeply about redefining what it means to be a leader. Leadership is neither a rank nor a title - it is a choice and it is a responsibility. Leadership is the choice to provide care and protection for those in our span of care. When we care more for our people, our people will care more for us. They will help progress the leader's and organization's vision to reality.

Along with my colleagues at Simon Sinek Inc. and Start With Why, I support leaders in building cultures that foster trust, where people feel valued and safe, so that they can go on to accomplish remarkable things. I challenge us to assess our relationship with technology, bringing the perspective that perhaps what we believe brings us together, is the very thing that isolates us. Though technology is a powerful tool, I believe that when we disconnect from it, we are more able to connect, create and innovate.

Today, we have a crisis in leadership. Research from Gallup and Deloitte show 87% of the 3 billion people employed worldwide feel they are not highly engaged in their work and that their employer does not care about them.

My life's work is to help people feel more fulfilled and engaged by the work they do. My teammates and I guide leaders and organizations to discover and articulate their Why - their driving cause, purpose or belief. Through keynotes, workshop facilitation, coaching, advising, tool and content creation, we inspire and support leaders to create cultures where their people feel valued and where there are leaders at every level.",Ivey Business School at Western University,2007 – 2009,stephen@startwithwhy.com,"(Leadership, Communications, Strategy)",False,,,,True,2018-09-26 10:24:55.056,"Hi Stephen, I came across your profile and think you'd be a good fit for a breakfast I host once a month at Soho House.

Born and raised in Newfoundland, I decided to move for the summer of 1996 from St. John’s to Toronto to work. My sister had been working for Juice Plus+ and one day I went to work with her, to look for a job in the area. Halfway through the day I found myself back in the warehouse of Juice Plus+, wondering what to do next. It just so happened the warehouse was busy and they asked if I wanted to work there for the week. At the end of the week, I was offered a job for the summer. I agreed and worked picking and packing Juice Plus+ products for shipment to our customers. At the end of the summer I was offered a full-time position.

I took the job and started taking CGA Ontario courses part-time. I was promoted to the Accounting Department within 6 months where I was responsible for accounts payable and other general accounting duties. After a year and a half, I realized that while I loved working for Juice Plus+, accounting just wasn’t for me. I was transferred to the sales and marketing department, and have never looked back.

I have stayed with Juice Plus+ for all of these years because of the PEOPLE and the MISSION. The company attracts heart-centered, mission driven people who want to make a difference. As Vice President of Sales and Marketing, I feel fortunate to be given the opportunity to travel around the globe and work with such an amazing team of representatives on the company’s mission, “To Inspire Healthy Living Around the World”. Hands down the greatest job in the world!

Jason has held a number of different roles through his tenure but his focus has always been on trying to provide perspective and context on the issues that impact Canadians’ savings goals. As a retirement and economic analyst, he contributed to the research used in over a dozen thought leadership articles and papers published by Fidelity Canada.

Jason has also lead Fidelity Canada’s market research initiatives, conducting surveys and focus groups to better understand industry trends as well as Canadians’ attitudes and perceptions about financial advice and their savings goals.

Other topics Jason has researched and spoken about at conferences include rational investing in an emotional world, examining how financial services can better help and engage young Canadians and, more recently, how digital disruption is affecting the financial advisor and asset management community.

Jason has also held positions in product development and media relations.

More and more, Canadians want to learn about a company through its content and they want to do it on their terms. Jason’s focus today is on sharing and amplifying the industry’s stories, research and headlines through social media and video.

Robert is an experienced strategic planner with a focus on translating strategy into tactical implementation. He is a change leader combining strong planning, implementation and team building skills with a proven track record of delivering on strategic goals and business results through generating growth, streamlining operations, reducing costs, increasing productivity and a focus on customer satisfaction.

The four uniquely diverse chapters of his career provide him with a very well-rounded perspective. His first six years were spent advancing up the technical management corporate ladder, giving him program and project management experience in a technical environment. The next chapter was all entrepreneurial with two unique companies, one in automation and the other retail product development. This provided Robert with many versatile transferable skills such as raising capital and financial management. Then, Robert honed his sales and marketing management skills and his P & L management in a public company. Today, Robert is applying his experience and knowledge to building a renewable energy company.

I can multi-task and manage many priorities simultaneously while making the correct decision of what needs to be done as opposed to what is easily done to clear the desk.

I have been strategically involved in setting operational process that improve efficiency and improve customer satisfaction. This easily translates into an ability to design the processes that will make the working relationship smooth between Global Marketing and Global Communications.

My unique career path has allowed me to develop expertise in content, product management, user experience design and agile software development. As a senior executive, I built the strategies for product creation on every major digital platform: Web, native apps, mobile web and wearables. I am a forward-thinking leader able to transform the way work gets done; my management approach is proven to empower and engage employees, accelerate product delivery, increase organizational transparency and strengthen the strategic planning process. I take the complex, simplify it, and then execute.

Leading in digital means more than simply launching great products: It requires change agents who can transform the way work is done and create organizational cultures that allow companies and employees to thrive amidst ambiguity and constant change. I have been a champion and student of agile management processes for almost a decade and have led transformations that took teams from dysfunctional to highly effective and delivery focused.

Colleagues know me as an attentive listener; intensely curious about every person’s perspective — a great idea can come from anywhere, regardless of rank or background! I create focused, energetic work environments and I know when to make hard decisions so a team can progress. Over the years, I have become adept at understanding when to empower an individual and give them room to blossom, and when to work intensely with them so that a problem doesn’t become overwhelming.

The all-too slow march of time took it's toll on Mark's eyesight, so much so that he was no longer able to thread a needle. This ended his hours-long dream of becoming a taxidermist. After wandering into the wrong section of his local Chapters/Indigo outlet, he inadvertently knocked a copy of ""Marketing for Dummies"" off the shelf, and immediately thought to himself, ""Hey, I can use that book to correct the uneven wabble of my desk.""

Since that providential moment, Mark has endured/enjoyed over 25 years of communications and marketing experience in the non-for profit sectors, honing his beach-combing skills at exotic locals like World Vision Canada and Mission Aviation Fellowship of Canada, as well as a smattering of freelance work.

$1.60 and his self-taught skills will get you a medium coffee at Tim Horton's, but extra change in your pocket could easily get you a side of brochures, websites, posters, direct mail appeals, and videos; all handcrafted using the finest ingredients that Photoshop, InDesign, and Premier Pro can provide.

From doodle to post production and everything in between, Mark's years of experience has created a vast understanding of all areas of the production process; knowledge he loves to share at family reunions and with strangers on the bus.

Mark uses his skills to produce stunningly detailed and personalized direct mail campaigns that have generated millions of dollars, and gotten him free upgrades at select Best Western hotels.

I have studied storytelling as well as business and have made a career combining these two passions. In the late ’90s, after working with some of the world’s top entrepreneurs in the financial services industry, I decided to tell their stories and coauthored two business books, which would later become bestsellers, one of them the number one business book in Canada.

I later cofounded a startup to train entrepreneurs. For the first couple of years, I worked out of my kitchen, developing the core training program. When it came time to go to market, I spearheaded a content marketing strategy, which allowed us to penetrate the competitive training marketplace. Within a few years I moved out of my kitchen to an office tower on Toronto’s Bay Street. We had a team of several dozen people and were working with leading financial institutions all over the world.

I eventually sold my stake in the startup and left to pursue various creative projects, including a series of novels, which were picked up by the head of a top literary agency. While writing, I freelanced as a content marketer. In 2012, I joined FreshBooks, where I managed the blog and led its transformation from a corporate blog into a business blog, establishing FreshBooks as a thought leader in its space. Under my leadership, the blog was featured by Inc.com as one of the top 5 company blogs to read.

I also coauthored FreshBooks’ first ebook, which saw over 130,000 downloads within three months, and was praised by several bestselling authors, including Tim Ferriss (The 4-Hour Workweek).

In 2013, I left FreshBooks to head up content marketing at Clearfit.

That’s the question I love to answer for organizations.

With over 10 years of experience spanning the nonprofit and academic sectors both as an employee and a consultant, I have consistently helped organizations stay ahead of the technology curve. In 2013, I led Pathways to Education to become the first Canadian charity to issue tax receipts for Bitcoin donations. To date we have raised $8000 in this innovative way, however what is more exciting is that we have opened access and awareness to a brand new tech-savvy audience.

I have taught Digital Marketing at George Brown College. I find it rewarding and inspiring to help students understand the power and potential of digital media and gain the confidence they need to succeed. When I have the opportunity I love to speak and write about digital marketing strategy, digital fundraising, online youth engagement, website analytics, and of course digital currency.

I’ve been honoured to be recognized by some wonderful organizations, including the 2014 NTEN Award for contributions to the nonprofit technology community. Most recently, I was awarded Young Alumnus of the Year by the Wilfrid Laurier University Alumni Association, which recognizes the outstanding achievements by a young alumnus.

Some other projects I’ve been involved with include The Fastest Donation Form in the World Project, where I initiated and led the development of a proof of concept to explore the question, “What would the fastest donation form in the world look like?”. The answer? 2 clicks and 15 seconds. And Roo.io, a mobile-optimized system that provides a streamlined and cost-effective way to record telephone interviews for content producers and journalists.",,,,,False,,,,True,2018-09-17 08:17:37.704,"Hi Jason, I came across your profile and think you'd be a good fit for a breakfast I host once a month at Soho House.

Along the way, I founded, built and sold DRUMS, an Internet software company, was an award-winning retail copywriter, and worked for and with some of the largest advertising agencies in the world.

My book ""Feed the Startup Beast"" (McGraw-Hill) is now out and in bookstores across the universe. The book is focused on delivering two things to startups: 1) a Marketing Operating System that works, and; 2) a software tool (free) to help entrepreneurs scale their marketing. 1) + 2) = secret to startup growth. Many thanks to my co-writer Jonathan Verney.

When I get the nerve up to shave something on the back of my head, it will be this: never stop trying.

Is it designed for flexibility with automation and features to get us to the top of a consumers shopping list?

For EDealer clients the answer is YES!

EDealer's *Consumer FIRST* sites focus on the fact that customers only visit 1.6 dealerships before deciding what car to buy and which dealership to buy from. Our solutions drive sales to you by digitally conveying information buyers want to see on their preferred device.

✪ As Director of Sales, I provide an introspective look into your digital business and develop solutions including detailed specs and incentives, custom landing pages, eCommerce, Digital Retailing, modules that easily convey information, and A/B tested paths to conversion. EDealer proudly delivers solutions trusted by over 800 Elite Canadian Auto Dealers. Is it time to join them?

✪ In addition to my role with EDealer, I'm involved in Dealer Development for our sister company, EBlock, an online vehicle auction where vehicles are bought and sold in 60 seconds. I would love to introduce you to our technology, which gives auto dealers the opportunity to inspect and sell vehicles in a live online auction from their own dealership.

Aside from work, I love to ski and golf, and my wife and I enjoy playing with our toddler son and spending quality time as a family.

In 2001, I formed a small interactive shop, that grew to a Digital Media leader in Canada, which was acquired by the largest Out-of-Home Company in Canada- which I now call home.

I'm the Digital Executive of the company, tasked with Digital Operations, Software, Hardware and Network build-out. I work to build scale able, professional operations, that are both business-sound and technically excellent. I have worked since 2005 closely with the TTC, as we have built their digital network, and modernized the way they talk to customers. Upon joining PATTISON, I lead the operations and system integration efforts, bringing the Onestop platform to all PATTISON digital signs. Included in this was an overhaul, and continued expansion of PATTISON's Digital Elevator Network.

The list of work is lengthy, the scar are numerous- each scar is a lesson, a badge of honor and price one pays for innovation. Failure is always a risk and a companion. With every crisis comes opportunity (Google it).

An old friend of mine coined it best: ""I love to jump jump off the cliff, and build the wings on the way down.""... haven't hit the bottom yet.
